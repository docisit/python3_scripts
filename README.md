portscan.py - 
  This is the first port scanner tool I wrote.  It outputs the results to a .txt file.  Which, it also ask you to name the .txt file, so that you do not overwrite past scans.  It also checks if ports are open or closed, and out puts this to the terminal, and to the file.  I have included the tags in the file, so you know what the functions do.
